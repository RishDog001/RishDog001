I have experience in Microsoft Office tools such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access. I have also learned various programming languages such as C#, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, ASP.NET MVC, Java, Python, and VBA. I also have experience using Adobe Creative Cloud, animation software such as Blender, and statistical tools such as PowerBI and Tableau. ðŸ‘‹
